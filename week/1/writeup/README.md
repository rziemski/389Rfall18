### Part 2 (75 pts)

*I would immediately tell my boss and explain the situation. I do not see a reason to tell anybody else. The more people you tell, the higher the chance of the issues getting leaked before they are fixed, which could be disatrous.I would of course explain the issues to the team of twenty developers I need, so they know what steps they need to take to fix the problem. I would think most companies would make me sign some kind of non-disclosure agreement when they hired me, so taking these findings out of the company could get me in legal trouble as well. If my boss agrees we need to postpone the ECU release to fix these issues, I would not tell anybody else. 
If the company was unwilling to take the time to fix these security issues, I would approach it differently. I would first take the news of these issues to someone I trusted who was also in the cybersecurity field, and have them try to convince the company to change their minds. If I could get someone else besides myself to agree with me and confirm that these are very serious issues, maybe the company would listen. If that did not work, I would go public as a last resort. 
I understand that telling a close friend outside of the company or even the public about these security issues would be violating any type of non-disclosure agreement I signed when I was hired. I would be willing to go that far because I do believe that if I did nothing to solve these issues, and somebody was harmed as a result, I would be responsible. If you are aware of an upcoming terrorist attack, and you do not tell anybody, I believe you are responsible for the harm caused by that attack, as well as anybody else involved in the attack. In the eyes of the law, if the police find out you held knowledge of an upcoming attack, you can get in legal trouble.*
